            Stateless IPIP proxy for Bootstrapping Protocols
         draft-richardson-anima-6tisch-stateless-ipip-proxy-00

Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism for a Join Proxy used in a variety
   of related enrollment protocols to forward arbitrary traffic in a
   stateless fashion.

   This mechanism uses IPIP encapsulation which can be compressed by 6lo
   mechanism.

1.  Introduction

   Enrollment of new nodes into constrained networks with constrained
   nodes present unique challenges.

   There are bandwidth and code space issues to contend.  Solutions such
   as [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] and
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-zerotouch-join] require that a new node
   (the "pledge") be helped by a Join Proxy.

   The Join Proxy needs to forward traffic from the Pledge to the Join
   Registrar/Coordinator (JRC), and then return responses from the JRC
   to the Pledge.  As detailed in
   [I-D.richardson-anima-state-for-joinrouter] there are many methods
   that can be used to forward the traffic.

   In each of the two join scenarios, the traffic between the Pledge and
   the Join Proxy is IPv6 Link-Local traffic.  The Pledge has no default
   gateway, nor any global routable address.  The Pledge believes a
   fiction that it has communicating with a JRC that is one link-local
   hop away.  The fiction is created so that the not-yet-trustworthy
   Pledge is not allocated any network resources, nor is it is permitted
   to communicate for any purpose other than enrollment.

   In all proxy mechanisms forwarding traffic to the JRC is relatively
   easy.  The traffic to the JRC appears to come from the Join Proxy,
   and non-Link-Local addresses are used (ULA ACP addresses in ANIMA/
   BRSKI, and GUA addresses in 6tisch, which has no ACP).

   The problem is returning traffic from the JRC to the correct Pledge.
   In general, there may be more than one Pledge active at any time, so
   some state is necessary to find the correct Pledge for a given
   packet.

   {{I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security} defines the "Stateless-Proxy CoAP
   Option" to store the state in the packet that is sent to the JRC.
   This eliminates the need to store any per-Pledge state in the Join
   Proxy.  This method only works for CoAP protocols where the security
   is inside of CoAP (i.e.  OSCORE), and fails for CoAPS (CoAP/DTLS), as
   the new option can not be inserted.

   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] contains a mandatory to
   implement (on the JRC!) use of a TCP circuit proxy.  In it's
   canonical 1990-era application firewall origins in the ALG proxy,
   this requires a process running on the Join Proxy that connects two
   TCP sockets together.  The NAPT mechanisms as defined in [RFC3022]
   can be used for the same effect.  The origin address (the Pledge's
   Link-Local address), is mapped to the Join Proxy's ACP address.  A
   temporary origin port number is allocated.  The destination address
   is statically changed from the Join Proxy's Link-Local address to the
   JRC's advertised address and port.  While this NAT66 method is
   cheaper than the historical ALG, it still has per-Pledge cost.  As
   the network on which device join may be open to any attacker, it is
   quite reasonable to expect an attacker to attempt to overwhelm the
   Join Proxy's state table.

   This document provides a third option, IPIP encapsulation in which
   UDP or TCP traffic (containing DTLS or TLS, or even raw CoAP) is
   forwarded using the IPIP header to encapsulate the original packet,
   and therefore maintaining the original headers.  This is essentially
   creation on a specific purpose Virtual (overlay) Network between the
   Join Proxy and the JRC.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8366], and are used
   identically as in that document: artifact, imprint, domain, Join
   Registrar/Coordinator (JRC), Manufacturer Authorized Signing
   Authority (MASA), pledge, Trust of First Use (TOFU), and Voucher.

3.  Requirements Language

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.
